There are three modes from which we can configure all alert types of Alerts-X. Understanding correctly these modes we will be able to know how to configure an alert to check what we want.

## Standard - Absolute

This mode has as objective to trigger the alert when a previously defined number of transactions do not accomplish the alert set rules.

## Standard - Relative

This mode has as objective to trigger the alert when a previously defined percentage of transactions do not accomplish the alert set rules.

## Comparative

This mode has as objective to compare two predefined windows and to trigger the alert when the variation between both exceeds the percentage defined in the alert configuration.
